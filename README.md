# Expresso

Express clone.

> This repository is for learning purposes. It may intentionally contain bugs or
fail to function properly. The code may be purposefully difficult to read,
contain syntax errors, or only be a partial solution. You should not base code
off of this and absolutely should not use it in production.

Obviously, you should just use Express.
